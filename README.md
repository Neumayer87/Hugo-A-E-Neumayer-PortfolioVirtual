# Hugo-A-E-Neumayer-VirtualPortfolio
This is my Virtual Portfolio of Data analytics/Data Science

This portfolio contains the Final Project that I did to pass the CoderHouse Data Analytics course. It presents the data analysis of an electronic security company. The documents explain the ETL process carried out with spreadsheets and Power Query. In addition to data visualization using a dashboard generated in Power BI. Finally, documents are presented where you can see conclusions of the data analysis.
